      "question": "How does PAK-ID app processing compare to center-based processing times?",
      "answer": "PAK-ID app submissions typically follow the same processing categories (Normal, Urgent, Executive) as center applications. Some digital services might be faster, but document printing and delivery still follow standard timelines."
    },
    {

      "question": "How does document complexity affect processing time within categories?",
