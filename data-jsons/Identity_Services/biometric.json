    },
    {
      "question": "What documents do I need to bring for a biometric update?",
      "answer": "For a biometric update, bring: your original CNIC/NICOP/POC (if available), any medical certificates if you have hand injuries or medical conditions affecting biometrics, and a copy of your previous application receipt (if available). No additional documents are required for authentication issue cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a biometric update process take?",
      "answer": "A biometric update typically takes 15-30 minutes at the center for the capture process. The system update is usually immediate, but may take up to 24-48 hours to reflect across all NADRA systems and databases."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my biometric update fails multiple times?",
      "answer": "If biometric update fails repeatedly: 1) Technical staff will try alternative capture methods, 2) Medical examination may be recommended for hand/finger conditions, 3) Alternative verification methods may be used, 4) Facial biometric may be prioritized over fingerprints, 5) Manual verification process may be initiated with additional documentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a biometric update done abroad at Pakistani consulates?",
