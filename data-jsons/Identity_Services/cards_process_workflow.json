      "question": "What is the complete workflow for ID card processing at NADRA?",
      "answer": "The ID card processing workflow involves 6 sequential steps: 1) Visit to NADRA Registration Center (NRC), 2) Q-Metic token issuance for queue management, 3) Data capturing (fee payment, photograph capture, fingerprint capture, personal data entry, application form printing), 4) Confirmation and data accuracy review, 5) Interview with NADRA officer, and 6) Data upload to central server for backend processing and validation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the first step in the NADRA ID card application process?",
      "answer": "The first step is to visit a NADRA Registration Center (NRC) to initiate the ID card application process."

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during the data capturing stage?",
      "answer": "During the data capturing stage, several processes occur in sequence: fee payment, photograph capture, fingerprint (biometric) capture, personal data entry, and application form printing. All these steps are completed when it's the applicant's turn based on their Q-Metic token number."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of biometric data are captured during the application process?",
      "answer": "During the application process, two types of biometric data are captured: fingerprints (biometric capture) and a photograph of the applicant."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens after the application form is printed?",
      "answer": "After the application form is printed, the applicant must review and confirm the printed form details for accuracy. This confirmation step ensures all entered information is correct before proceeding further."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the interview in the NADRA process?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to the data after the interview is completed?",
      "answer": "After the interview is completed, the collected data is uploaded to NADRA's central server for backend processing and further validation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who conducts the interview during the NADRA application process?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens at NADRA's central server?",
      "answer": "At NADRA's central server, the collected applicant data undergoes backend processing and further validation after being uploaded from the registration center."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to bring anything for the photograph during the application?",
      "answer": "No, the photograph is captured at the NADRA center during the data capturing stage as part of the application process. You don't need to bring passport photos."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the queue system work at NADRA centers?",
      "answer": "The queue system works through Q-Metic tokens. When you arrive at a NADRA Registration Center, you receive a Q-Metic token with a queue number. You wait for your turn based on this number, ensuring orderly and systematic service delivery."
    },
    {
      "question": "What validation occurs during the NADRA application process?",
      "answer": "Validation occurs at two stages: during the in-person interview where a NADRA officer validates submitted data and assesses eligibility, and at the central server where backend processing and further validation of uploaded data takes place."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there multiple NADRA Registration Centers available?",
      "answer": "Yes, there are multiple NADRA Registration Centers (NRCs) available where applicants can visit to initiate their ID card application process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the complete ID card processing workflow take at the center?",
      "answer": "The complete workflow typically takes 2-4 hours depending on crowd, queue position, and application complexity. Individual steps take: Q-Metic token (5 minutes), Data capturing (30-45 minutes), Confirmation (10 minutes), Interview (15-20 minutes), Data upload (5-10 minutes). Peak times may increase waiting periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if there are technical issues during biometric capture?",
      "answer": "If biometric capture fails: staff will attempt multiple captures using different techniques, clean the scanner and try again, use alternative fingers if some are damaged, escalate to technical support if needed, and document the issue for potential free re-capture later. The process may be paused until technical issues are resolved."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I leave the center between steps and return later?",
      "answer": "No, the workflow is designed as a continuous process. Once you receive your Q-Metic token, you should remain at the center to complete all steps in sequence. Leaving may require restarting the entire process with a new token and queue number."
    },
    {
      "question": "What specific questions are asked during the NADRA interview?",

The officer may ask for clarification on any inconsistencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens after the data upload to central server?",
      "answer": "After data upload: your application enters the backend processing queue, automated verification checks are performed, document authenticity is verified, biometric matching occurs, final approval or rejection decision is made, and your application status is updated in the system. You'll receive SMS/email notifications about progress."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can family members be processed together in the same workflow?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What if I make an error during the confirmation stage?",
      "answer": "If you find errors during confirmation: immediately inform the staff before proceeding, corrections can be made during the data capturing stage, the form will be reprinted with correct information, you'll need to re-confirm the corrected form, and there's no additional fee for corrections made during the same visit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any accessibility accommodations in the workflow process?",
