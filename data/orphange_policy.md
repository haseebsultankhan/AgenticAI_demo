# ORPHANAGE REGISTRATION POLICY

*Dated: 24/02/2016*

## 1. Background

The registration of orphans with NADRA is a critical step in safeguarding their fundamental rights and ensuring their inclusion in society. Orphan children are among the most vulnerable segments of the society, often facing challenges such as lack of access to education, healthcare, and social protection. Through proper registration, these children can secure a legal identity, which is the cornerstone of their recognition as equal citizens under the law.
