# TRANSGENDER REGISTRATION POLICY

**National Database and Registration Authority**

In order to recognize the dignity and equal rights of every person as guaranteed by the Constitution of Pakistan and to acknowledge the fundamental principles of nondiscrimination and equal opportunities, it is imperative to ensure the seamless registration of transgender persons with NADRA. This policy aims to establish a transparent and easy process for the registration of transgender persons, ensuring their access to identification documents and associated benefits for social, economic and legal inclusion. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018 further reinforces these rights and mandates the protection and facilitation of transgender persons in accessing identification and other public services.
